# Radio playing bot
## Discord bot that gets audio from a radio and plays it in your voice channel
### Not hosted anywhere because it is not exactly very budget friendly as it uses a lot of memory, I host it on my pc when I play with my friends

## How to use
1. You need to create your own bot in discord developer portal
2. Run this by downloading or cloning the repo to your local environment
3  Install node modules 
4. Add a .env file with TOKEN variable with your bot ID as value
